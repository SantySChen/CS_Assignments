2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?
	1) Value type will directly hold the value while reference type will hold the memory address or reference for the value.
	2) Value type is stored in the stack memory but reference type is stored in the heap memory.
	3) Value type will not be collected by garbage collector but reference type will be collected by garbage collector
	4) The value type is created by struct or enum while reference type is created by calss, interface, delegate or array
	5) Value type can not accept null values whereas reference types can accept null values.

	boxing is the operation to convert value type to the reference type/object type.
	Unboxing is the operation to convert reference type/object type to value type.

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
	The managed resources are that are managed by the .Net runtime. The .Net Garbage Collector automatically tracks and handles the 
	memory of these resources, cleaning them up when they are no longer in use.
	The unmanaged resources are that are unmanaged by the .Net runtime. They are typically resources that come from outside the CLR
	environment.

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
	To allocate objects on managed heap efficiently and do not need to manually release memory.
